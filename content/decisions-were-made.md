#### *This time it's happening.*

I've been delving into all sorts of programming technologies in the last five years, so I can understand how hard it can be for someone to enter this field. Having a computer background helps, but even then, there are times that it feels impossible to grasp, let alone master some concepts. In the past, I've studied C, Java, Android Development, Web Development, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, but nothing really seemed to stick. All these languages/frameworks are difficult enough and if you spread yourself thin, it's impossible to do it.

#### *So, I made a decision.*

I'm (mainly) sticking to web development until I make it. It feels natural to me to wander and study blockchain development, or machine learning, but I'm going to try and keep that to a minimal level and only do it after I reach my web development goals I've set for the day/week. If done correctly, learning about different technologies reinforces one's programming knowledge as a whole. **Consistency is the key to success.**

#### *Which resources am I using?*

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
 
    Free Code Map is my main resource of knowledge. The curriculum it the most complete I've seen in this subject and not much hand holding is going on.

- [Udemy - The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
- [Udemy - The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/)

    I believe that Colt Steel's first course is better, but they both helped me understand some concepts.

- [Eloquent Javascript](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-2nd-Ed-Introduction/dp/1593275846/)

    I wouldn't consider Eloquent Javascript to be a beginner's book, but it has clear explanations that complement the other resources I've listed.

While the quality of the resources someone is using matters, **the most important aspect of learning is doing**. And that holds true for everything. Michael Jordan didn't become an amazing basketball player by watching basketball games. And neither will you. If you want to become a programmer, you should code. Not watch tutorials, not copy & paste code. Actually do the time and write the code!

#### *Why the blog?*

There are many programming blogs out there by people who are way more knowledgeable than I am. 

So why did I decide to start another programming blog?

I can think of two main reasons.

1. I want to document my progress from zero(ish) to a developer.
2. I want to show a different view. Not an expert's view, but the actual process of becoming a developer. The epiphanies, the knowledge, the frustrations that someone faces on the road to becoming a developer.

Hopefully, someone can get something out of this that will help on his/her undoubtedly long way to success!
