### Coding is Hard

Every one that has attempted to learn coding, has hit some walls along the road. Maybe not the genius type of person that started coding when he/she was eight, but that is definitely not the majority of the development world. 

### Motivation is a Double-Edged Sword

In the early learning stages everything seems easy. You are breezing through every tutorial, you suddenly feel like a magician and it seems like you were born to do this. You might be thinking that soon enough, you will be able to write the code for the next Halo, or the app to rule all apps. And then it happens. 

*You hit your first wall.*

Suddenly, your magic powers have left you and you're sitting there looking at the screen, wondering what went wrong. However, it is the first wall, so you somehow make it past it. Your confidence is back, along with your motivation. But, that's only the beginning. The walls keep on coming and you need to find your way past them. That is how web development works and you need to be prepared for it. Experience doesn't make the walls disappear. It just makes you more competent in conquering them.

### Consistency or How to Learn to Code

In order to form a habit, one needs to perform a daily action for a set period. Habits such as brushing your teeth in the morning, or drinking a glass of water after you wake up are easy to acquire. Research has shown that the minimum number of consecutive action days for simple habits can be as low as 21. Coding is not exactly a habit, but it works in a similar way. Will you be a coding magician in 21 days? No, probably not. The amount of time will differ, depending on your background, the time you spend on a daily basis and other deciding factors. But, working towards that goal on a daily basis is key to your success.

### Programming Roadmap and a Challenge

Nowadays, websites such as [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) have answered the question.

*"Where do I start?"*.

That has only led to the next question.

*"Where do I go next?"*.

My suggestions are:

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

[P1xt Guides on GitHub](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides)

These are not as easy as Codecademy and they won't hold your hand along the entire way. But that is the way to learn. Sooner, or later you will need to swim on your own.

Do you want to keep yourself accountable along the way?

Try the [#100DaysofCode challenge](http://www.100daysofcode.com/).

There are only two rules.

- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

Start today, code at least an hour for the next 100 days. 

Save your code and ideally push it to GitHub.

*Most importantly, have fun!*
